# Callcredit Open Source Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in Callcredit-managed open source communities, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our open source communities strive to:

 * **Be friendly and patient:** Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
 * **Be welcoming:** Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
 * **Be respectful:** We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
    * Violent threats or language.
    * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
    * Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
    * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
 * **Understand disagreements:** Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
 * This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all repos and communities for Callcredit-managed open source projects regardless of whether or not the repo explicitly calls out its use of this code. The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at OpenSourceAdmin@callcreditgroup.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
